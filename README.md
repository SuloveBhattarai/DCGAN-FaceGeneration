# Face Generation using DCGAN

### Download

The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle: CelebA Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset).

## Overview
This project aims to create a fake images using a CelebA dataset. Architecture of DCGAN is utilized to generate the images
Only 2000 images were used for the training. 
All the images were resized into 64 x 64 pixels which could be fed into the architecture for training
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Generator

Generator starts with a random noise from latent space = 100, uses convolutional layers to generate **64X64** image. 
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;
The output of generator is between -1 to 1. 

## Discriminator
It takes a values and distinguish between real and fake images generated by the generator


## Note: 
However, due to lack of resources to train the total 200000 images, I have used only 2000 so, the generated images was not good. Increasing of epochs and changing of model architecture can be used to generate better images.
